    // When a client does not respond to a ping within this timeout, the server closes the connection.
    // Recommended value: 25000ms (25s)
    // Reason: API Gateway has a default idle timeout of 29 seconds, and the round-trip latency for Lambda responses can vary. Keeping this slightly below 29s ensures the connection doesn't get dropped unexpectedly.
    pingTimeout: 25000,
    // pingInterval (Default: 25000ms)
    // This controls how often pings are sent from the server to the client to keep the connection alive.
    //     Recommended value: 10000ms (10s)
    // Reason: Since AWS Lambda is stateless and might scale down, we need frequent heartbeats to keep the connection active. A 10s interval helps maintain a responsive connection without excessive pings.
